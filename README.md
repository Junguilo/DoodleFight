## Reference
This Project is heavily referenced & inspired from 
- [github](https://github.com/xenova/doodle-dash)
- [blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/ml-web-games)
for learning `transformers.js` AI and the ability to `detect drawings in real time`. 

# What I learned
This project was for me to take a look at transformers.js and to get better with React/Other Tech Stacks.
